# Module13-Challenge:Earthquake_Challenge
## Overview
Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
## Project Process
### (1) Add Tectonic Plates

### (3) Add Third Layer
The two pictures above have showed that the third layer, dark mode, was successfully added to the base map.  
Finally, here is the screenshot of all jobs done.
